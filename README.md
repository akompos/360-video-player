# 360-video-player
There are a lot of good 360 video players out there but this is just a super simple one that you can then overlay assests on the video. 

# How to use the dam thing
- You'll need a 360 video (or not but it will look a little bit funny) in both mp4 and OGV format. 
- Place both the mp4 and OGV files in the "StreamingAssets" folder of the project.
- Open the "360Player" scene and select the MovieSurface GameObject.
- Change the "Movie Name" field of the "Movie Player Sample" script to the name of your mp4 file in the StreamingAssets folder. For example, "YourMP4File.mp4"
- Build and run the "360Player" scene
